I am currently in the middle of my Xmas vacation and I was just about to download a movie for tonight.
While downloading, I checked my emails, which I haven’t really checked since Christmas Eve.

An invitation to join the [Apache ServiceMix](https://servicemix.apache.org) project as a committer was waiting for me on the top of my Inbox.

Of course I accepted the invitation and I immediately started blogging about it…
That’s a great ending for 2010 but its also a serious indication that I am going to need a time trasplant for 2011!
