1 week after my vacation and still suffering from “post vacation depression”, this Monday seemed like a nightmare.

I went to the office and I was feeling the urge to go get my self a huge Carafe of coffee (cups have long been proven inefficient), when an icoming email draw my attention.

It was an invitation to join [Apache Karaf](https://karaf.apache.org) team as a committer.

This is the first open source project I join and I’m very thrilled (if not overreacting) about it and that’s why I decided to blog about it.

I am looking forward working even more closely with this team.

Well, it seems that Mondays aren’t that crappy after all!
