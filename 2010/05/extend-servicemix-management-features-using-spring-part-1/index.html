Moreover this affected the rest of the service units contained in the service assemblies, which would be restarted too.</p><p>An other common problem was that I could not start, stop and restart a single service unit. That was a major problem since I often needed to be able to stop sending messages, while being able to accept messages in the bus. The only option I had was to split our service units in multiple service units <em>(e.g. inbound service unit and outbound service unit)</em>.</p><p>Solution<br>This series of blog post will demonstrate how we used spring in order to:</p><ol><li>Obtain service unit lifecycle management via jmx.</li><li>Expose endpoint and marshaler configuration via jmx.</li><li>Perform configuration changes on live production environements.</li><li>Persisting these changes to database.</li><li>Loading endpoint custom configuration from database.</li></ol></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
