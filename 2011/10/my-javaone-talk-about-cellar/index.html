<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>I had the chance to make a BOF about Karaf Cellar last Tuesday night. Even though the presentation was really late (20:30) and there were a lot of parties going on at this time (actually I was at the Jboss party right before my presentation) there were quite a few people that attended. The best part was that most of the people who attended were really eager to hear about Karaf & Cellar and I received a lot of great “straight to the point” questions. So I really enjoyed the talk and had a lot of fun.</p><figure><img src=panel.jpg></figure><p>I was worried that I would be really nervous, since I am not that used at public speaking, but I think the drinks I had in the Jboss party did the trick.</p><figure><img src=presenting.jpg></figure><h2 id=after-the-talk>After the talk

<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>Apart from talking and attending other sessions at JavaOne, I also had the chance to spent a lot of time at the booth of FuseSource. Great chance to meet with people enjoying our services and also to talk with people interested in learning more about FuseSource Products & FuseSource success stories.</p><h2 id=the-is-no-place-like-home>&ldquo;The is no place like home&rdquo;

Well, actually there is and is called San Francisco, but now I am back home & ready to dive into open source. I hope I’ll have the chance to be there next year.</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
